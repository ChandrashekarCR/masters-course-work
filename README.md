# Master's Program in Bioinformatics - Lund University

This repository contains a collection of scripts, data, and reports generated as part of my Master's program in Bioinformatics at Lund University. The content is organized into three subfolders, each corresponding to a specific course focused on coding and computational techniques.

## Subfolders

### 1. BINP16 - Python Programming
This folder contains:
- A variety of Python programming exercises, assignments, and exams.
- Subdirectories for specific running exercises, each with their own:
  - **Data**: Input files such as sequence data, parameter files, and example outputs.
  - **Scripts**: Python scripts used for solving bioinformatics problems, including `malaria.py` and `FastaAligner.py`.
  - **Results**: Output files generated by the scripts, including alignment results and heatmaps.
  - **Visualizations**: Plots and dendrograms generated for comparison studies.

### 2. BIOS13 - Modelling Biological Systems
This folder includes:
- Exam questions and presentation files (PDFs and PowerPoint) for various topics.
- Scripts in R for modeling biological systems, such as population dynamics and gene frequency simulations.
- Exam-related scripts and plots, including phase plane diagrams, time series, and coupled dynamics simulations.

### 3. BIOS14 - Processing and Analysis of Biological Data
This folder encompasses:
- Input data files related to damselfly studies, including CSV files for female and male datasets.
- Scripts in R and related files (RMarkdown, LaTeX, and logs) for statistical analysis and data visualization.
- Results including ANOVA plots, histograms, QQ plots, scatter plots, and contour plots to analyze interactions and thresholds.

### 4. BINP28 - DNA Sequence Informatics I

This repository contains a bash script (`variant_processing.sh`) that performs a comprehensive downstream analysis of a Variant Call Format (VCF) file. The analysis includes variant filtering, population structure inference using ADMIXTURE, and phylogenetic tree construction.  The script utilizes several bioinformatics tools, including `bcftools`, `vcftools`, `plink`, `iqtree2`, `fastme`, and `R`.

This folder includes:
- A scripts folder that contains all the scripts used for the analysis.
- It also contains a README.md file and an environment YML file. 

## Note
The materials in this repository represent only the coding-focused courses I have taken. They include a variety of exercises, assignments, and exams that were submitted and completed during the program. See each folder for a detailed explanation of the projects, exams and exercises.

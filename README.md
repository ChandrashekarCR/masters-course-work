# Master's Program in Bioinformatics - Lund University

This repository contains a collection of scripts, data, and reports generated as part of my Master's program in Bioinformatics at Lund University. The content is organized into three subfolders, each corresponding to a specific course focused on coding and computational techniques.

## Subfolders

### 1. BINP16 - Python Programming
This folder contains:
- A variety of Python programming exercises, assignments, and exams.
- Subdirectories for specific running exercises, each with their own:
  - **Data**: Input files such as sequence data, parameter files, and example outputs.
  - **Scripts**: Python scripts used for solving bioinformatics problems, including `malaria.py` and `FastaAligner.py`.
  - **Results**: Output files generated by the scripts, including alignment results and heatmaps.
  - **Visualizations**: Plots and dendrograms generated for comparison studies.

### 2. BIOS13 - Modelling Biological Systems
This folder includes:
- Exam questions and presentation files (PDFs and PowerPoint) for various topics.
- Scripts in R for modeling biological systems, such as population dynamics and gene frequency simulations.
- Exam-related scripts and plots, including phase plane diagrams, time series, and coupled dynamics simulations.

### 3. BIOS14 - Processing and Analysis of Biological Data
This folder encompasses:
- Input data files related to damselfly studies, including CSV files for female and male datasets.
- Scripts in R and related files (RMarkdown, LaTeX, and logs) for statistical analysis and data visualization.
- Results including ANOVA plots, histograms, QQ plots, scatter plots, and contour plots to analyze interactions and thresholds.

### 4. BINP28 - DNA Sequence Informatics I

This repository contains a bash script (`variant_processing.sh`) that performs a comprehensive downstream analysis of a Variant Call Format (VCF) file. The analysis includes variant filtering, population structure inference using ADMIXTURE, and phylogenetic tree construction.  The script utilizes several bioinformatics tools, including `bcftools`, `vcftools`, `plink`, `iqtree2`, `fastme`, and `R`.

This folder includes:
- A scripts folder that contains all the scripts used for the analysis.
- It also contains a README.md file and an environment YML file. 

### 5. BINP29 - Malaria Phylogenetics and Comparative Genomics Project

This folder contains scripts, data, and results related to a bioinformatics pipeline developed for the phylogenetic and comparative genomic analysis of *Plasmodium* species. The core of the project is the `malaria_pipeline.sh` script, which automates genome filtering, gene prediction, ortholog identification, and phylogenetic tree reconstruction using RAxML.

#### **Folder Structure:**
- **Scripts**: Contains essential scripts, including:
  - `malaria_pipeline.sh`: The main pipeline script for processing genomic data.
  - `filtering_scaffolds.py`: Python script for filtering *Haemoproteus tartakovskyi* genome scaffolds based on GC content and length.
  - `busco_protein_fasta.py`: Extracts protein sequences for BUSCO analysis.
  - `datParser.py`: Parses and extracts relevant genomic information from `.dat` files.

#### **Pipeline Overview:**
The `malaria_pipeline.sh` script executes the following steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Calculates genome size and GC content.
   - Extracts gene counts from annotation files.
2. **Genome Filtering:**
   - Removes *Haemoproteus tartakovskyi* scaffolds with GC content >28% and length <3000 nt.
3. **Gene Prediction:**
   - Uses GeneMark-ES for gene prediction.
4. **Functional Annotation:**
   - Performs BLASTx searches against SwissProt to identify homologous genes.
5. **Phylogenetic Analysis:**
   - Aligns sequences and constructs maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees with RAxML.

A dedicated conda environment (`malaria_env`) manages dependencies, with an additional `busco_env` for BUSCO analysis. The repository ensures reproducibility by specifying software environments and input data locations.

This project provides a structured approach to investigating *Plasmodium* evolution and comparative genomics through automated bioinformatics workflows.


## Note
The materials in this repository represent only the coding-focused courses I have taken. They include a variety of exercises, assignments, and exams that were submitted and completed during the program. See each folder for a detailed explanation of the projects, exams and exercises.
